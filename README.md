# Badger Shop

This was an assigned project in my UX devlopment class, that asked us to redesign of a very basic text webpage into something more user friendly. We were required to use full developmental steps to understand the entire design and devlopment process. 

We followed these steps:
    1. Empathize
    2. Define
    3. Ideate
    4. Prototype
    5. Implement
